# About Me

I'm Eddie Lee — co-founder of Cloudfox Group Ltd and a systems thinker at heart.

My background blends property ops, finance, and technology. Cloudfox was born out of a need to deliver implementation and integration with less fluff, more function. Whether it’s structuring HubSpot pipelines or designing ETL workflows, I’m focused on making systems work for the people using them.

**What I value:**
- Clean architecture
- Measurable results
- Quiet, confident execution
