# Eddie Lee

**Systems-savvy strategist. Tech-first operator. Builder of Cloudfox.**

I simplify complexity for property businesses by wiring together the systems they rely on â€” from HubSpot and Xero to Stripe and PMS platforms. With a balance of financial precision and automation-first design, I help clients scale operations, not admin.

## Current Focus
- Grand Slam Offers for PBSA & BTR
- SaaS tools for landlord analytics
- Property ops Slack community
- Client onboarding & automation workflows
